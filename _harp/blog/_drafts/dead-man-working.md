# The Humiliation of Teambuilding Exercises and Capitalism's Final Frontier  

"Capitalism has always destroyed the thing it needs the most. But when it is the
very humanity of the employee - his or her capacity to communicate, think
creatively and be social - an array of hired occupational scientists have
attempted the impossible: to *inject life into the dead zone of work*."

Deluze notes:

All institutions form into one. "Like a universal system of deformation".

Work and life are now one (Ricardo Semler)... is this the dream of capitalism?

Has work and life finally reconcilled? The authors argue that it hasn't.

There is an odd coercive nature to 'fun' in the office. 

Is mandatory fun a paradox?

The idea of formalized informality:

> You are forced, weirdly, to be yourself

Just 'being yourself' is a way for companies to tap into what really makes
humans, well, human. In the service oriented world, the winner is the one who
can deliver the most authenticity - and thus, it becomes commoditized and milked
out of us.
