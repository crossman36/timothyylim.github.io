### ethereum: a primer

*resources to get one started with understanding ethereum, to be updated frequently in the future*

Explained by user [HoYin Cheung](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Ethereum-in-laymans-term) on Quora:

```
Are you familiar with Napster or Bit Torrent which is a form of peer to peer file sharing? Basically, if I have a file, I can share that file in a network of computers and everyone will download it from me and have a copy of that file.

At a high level (not specific technicalities), Ethereum is similar but we are all sharing an Operating System like Windows or Mac, and it is constantly being updated and checked by all the computers within the network. It is so complex that we can even run programs on it, like payment processor, a chat application, or even a Facebook.

The difference between Facebook/Google/Whatsapp and applications on Ethereum is that Facebook are still centralized (i.e., they own the servers, database, hardware all over the world to provide a service). Since it is a centralized these companies dictate user terms and conditions, policy, privacy, and other things. Ethereum provides an decentralized alternative to this and "in theory" giving the power back to the users and making it more democratic.

The very first posts in the ethereum blog are very interesting:

Not that the number after 'page' in the url increases as new pages are added to the blog so maybe in the future one will have to click to see the very oldest posts.
