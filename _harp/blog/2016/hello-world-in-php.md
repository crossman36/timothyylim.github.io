### hello world in php

Coming from the world of academic programming (i.e. sterile and uninspiring homework) web development seemed wild and chaotic, but that's half the fun, isn't it? Anyway, let's say hello world in php.

**setting up the local host**

Install MAMP (or any other non-Mac equivalent).

Open it up and familiarize yourself with the directory of where your files will be served from. 

**saying hello**

Navigate to the directory from where MAMP serves its files, in there create a file called ```helloworld.php```

Open up ```helloworld.php``` and in it type the following:

```
<?php
  echo "hello world";
>
```

Open up MAMP and click Open WebStart page. 

Click on 'My Website' on the top bar. This will tell MAMP to open up it's root directory.

Click on ```helloworld.php```  and you should see your message to yourself, you lonely person.
