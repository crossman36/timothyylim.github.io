**Jacob Lund Fisker**

This Danish guy has been instrumental in changing my perspective when it comes to work and life in general. I've spent many hours
digging about his [blog](http://earlyretirementextreme.com) and for a more consice presentation of his philosophy have a look at his
[book](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/ere-book). I have an electronic copy so don't hesitate to email me. I particularly like 
his treatment of early retirement because he doesn't take the angle of being frugal for the sake of it but rather, puts the 
idea of non-work in the greater context of the economic system. It's more of a 
philosophical treatise more than a guidebook to saving, in my opinion.

**Why Your House Is A Terrible Investment**

A prennial favourite, jlconnsnh's [article](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/29/why-your-house-is-a-terrible-investment/)
challenges the commonly-held belief that buying a house is always a good thing. His series on stock investing is also quite good.
