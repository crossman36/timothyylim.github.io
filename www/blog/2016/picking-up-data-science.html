Since a friend asked, here&#39;s a short article on picking up data science.</p>
<h4>figuring out what it is</h4><p>Most jobs that advertise &#39;data scientist&#39; positions aren&#39;t looking for a phd statistician (or even a master&#39;s level one), but rather someone who can access a database, pull some relevant information out of it and then present it in a meaningful way. I did a little bit of this at my internship at postoexpress and I would say that most of a normal business&#39; needs aren&#39;t too sophisticated but it takes a practiced hand and a keen eye to wrangle data and draw insights at pace. This article entitled <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-that-s-a-good-thing-c6371885f7f6?gi=3a062780a0df">data scientists mostly just do arithmetic and that&#39;s a good thing</a> was useful.</p>
<h4>getting the right mentality</h4><p>There is no &#39;right way&#39; to do data science. Context is everything, so don&#39;t be discouraged if things seem to technical or too mathy. Just pick things up as you go along and be patient.</p>
<h4>inspiration</h4><p><a href="http://www.randalolson.com/blog/">Randal Olson</a>: This guy is a genius/beast/saint/genius-beast-saint. His blog is always fun and it opened my mind up to what data analysis can do. One of my favourites was a machine-learning algorithm to find <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/">the optimal search path to find &#39;Waldo&#39;in &quot;Where&#39;s Waldo&quot; books</a>. </p>
<p>General Reading: keep searching for data science-y type questions and immerse yourself in the discussion. </p>
<h4>get (your hands) dirty</h4><p>Install python. Figure out how to use ipython notebooks. Figure out how to use pandas (it&#39;s a thing, trust me). Play with data from your work (that&#39;s quite dull, though) or from anything you find geniunely interesting (football, for example). Mess around and have fun.</p>
<h4>online courses</h4><p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359">Udacity&#39;s Intro to Data Science</a>: pretty good, but has quite a few holes in terms of teaching you how to program. Take the course for free and work through the examples. Search github for solutions and do your best to learn from others&#39; work. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>: I haven&#39;t done any Kaggle challenges myself but they seem like great tutorials especially to get your hands dirty with data in a &#39;clean&#39; environment (read: no data wrangling). Do the most basic challenges and again, search github like a maniac. </p></div></div></body></html>
